# Simple Demo for USC Data Project One
A VERY rudimentary example of what project one might look like.

## Project Goal
Demonstrate a simple organizational structure and workflow for the first project in the USC Data Bootcamp.

## Team Members
- Hunter Carlisle [github.com/huntingcarlisle](https://github.com/huntingcarlisle)
- Cooper Boer [github.com/CooperBoer](https://github.com/CooperBoer)

## Analysis
SpaceX shoots heavy rockets into space.

You should do more thorough analysis here. 

Include pictures like this as well:

!['Launch Payloads'](./images/launch_payloads.jpg 'Launch Payloads')

Aim for 3-4 detailed paragraphs (or 8-10 smaller paragraphs, which is my personal writing style).

## Requirements
- `pandas`
- `python 3`
- `json`
- `requests`
- `matplotlib`
- `jupyter`

## Instructions to Recreate Analysis
1. Clone the Repo to your local machine
2. Install Python 3
3. Install dependencies with `pip install pandas matplotlib`
4. Open Jupyter with `jupyter lab`
5. Run Jupyter notebooks found in `/notebooks/` directory: Ingest, Clean, Visualize

## Markdown Tips
For a cheatsheet of formatting techniques for the README.md file—such as including images, links, headers, lists, and codeblocks—see [Adam P's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
